# MHW-Mod-Manager
## A Linux solution for Monster Hunter World modding

**What is it?**
- A very simple and intuitive GUI application that allows Linux users to manage mods for ``Monster Hunter World``.

**Things to know before using it?**
- This app relies on ``yad`` to run correctly, since it's the extension used for the GUI to be displayed. Most of the times it can just be installed from the console using most of the package managers available per distro.

**How does it work?**
- Call ``App.yad`` as an executable from your terminal.
- Change the path of your installation if the default one isn't right.
- To add mods, use the ``Install Mod`` button.
- To remove mods, double click the one you wish to uninstall from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> You might be prompted to install either ``7z`` or ``unrar`` depending on the mods you are trying to add into your game, since those two are the default apps to open 7z, rar, and zip files. They can be installed using your default package manager in most distros.
